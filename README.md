## Getting Started

For most of the examples, I've provided a Makefile to make it easy to jump in.
Make sure you have make installed by running the following command:

```bash
sudo apt install -y make
```

Then you can move into a particular directory, and run all of the unit tests with the command:

```bash
make test
```

For example, if you wanted to run the example for djikstra's algorithm written in python:

```bash
cd data_structures_and_algorithms/graphs/dijkstra/python
make test
```
