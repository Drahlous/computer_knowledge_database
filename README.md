### Note
A significant portion of the DSA information contained within this repository is adopted from the book [Grokking Algorithms](https://github.com/egonSchiele/grokking_algorithms).
While several of the coding samples in this repo follow the book very closely, others are my own (sometimes hacky) implementations.
If you're looking for strictly accurate implementations, I would encourage that you use caution and remain skeptical of the code provided here.

Otherwise, please join me in exploring a selection of topics across computer science! 

## Getting Started

For most of the examples, I've provided a Makefile to make it easy to jump in.
Make sure you have make installed by running the following command:
```bash
sudo apt install -y make
```

Then you can move into a particular directory, and run all of the unit tests with the command:
```bash
make test
```

For example, if you wanted to run the example for djikstra's algorithm written in python:
```bash
cd data_structures_and_algorithms/graphs/dijkstra/python
make test
```
