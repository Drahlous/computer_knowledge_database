# Binary Search

## Overview

Binary search is the simple algorithm we use when looking for an item in a sorted set:

- Find a word in the dictionary

- Playing a number guessing game (too high / too low)

## Complexity

Binary search has a `Logarithmic log(n)` time complexity.

The intuition is that each search `halves` the remaining search space.

### Notes

- `Binary search` is much faster than a simple search
